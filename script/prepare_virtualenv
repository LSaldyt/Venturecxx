# Create a new virtual environment to install Venture (and its Python dependencies):
virtualenv env.d

# If (some) Python dependencies were pre-installed these can be used by typing
virtualenv --system-site-packages env.d

# Activate the environment, and install any remaining dependencies
source env.d/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Be sure to put nose into the virtualenv, so it can find its packages
pip install --ignore-installed nose

# [Optional] Install ggplot (needed for the built-in plotting facilities)
pip install ggplot
