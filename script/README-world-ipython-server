What I did to get ipython for the PPAML summer school students:
- Create a user axch-ipython on probcomp-2
- Copy the notebooks into that user's home directory
- (install ipython-notebook)
- Follow the instructions to set up a public IPython server:
  http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/rel-1.1.0/interactive/public_server.html
  Synthesize password 'ppaml'
  Synthesize self-signed cert in notebook.pem
  ipython profile create nbserver
