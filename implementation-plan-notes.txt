Step 0: Refactor stack INFER instruction and existing calls to be extensible to the new spec
- Eliminate "use_global_scaffold" in favor of "all" on the "default" block
Step 1: Block MH in Lite controlled by the stack


Is there right now a way to say how many particles pgibbs should use?
- Selsam says "hardcoded in inc/infer/pgibbs.h as the variable P".

Patch the spec:
- pgibbs should accept a count of repeats as well as particles
- meanfield maybe not, because it does not read the contents of the scaffold
  - though iterating (meanfield one) may make sense
