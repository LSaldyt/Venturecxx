Venture is a higher-order probabilistic programming platform that aims
to be sufficiently expressive, extensible, and efficient for
general-purpose use.  We intend Venture to be useful in all domains
and areas where software must deal with uncertainty or potentially
incomplete models.  This includes the traditional fields of machine
learning, statistcs, and artifical intelligence; traditional domains
where those methods have found fruit, such as robotics, finance,
economics, computer vision, scientific simulation, political science,
and natural language processing; and potential applications in new
domains where probabilistic modeling has not yet been applied
successfully.

To this end, we are designing Venture to

- be able to express any probabilistic process as a model and

- be able to carry out any inference strategy on any model to which it
  applies,

- including nesting modeling inside inference and inference inside
  modeling,

- supporting a separation of concerns that permits implementing
  generic inference strategies as reusable library procedures,

- while retaining all the efficiency of custom implementations,
  including opportunities for parallelism, and

- interfacing smoothly with foreign or legacy model or inference
  programs.

In pursuit of this ambitious set of goals we have, to date, sacrificed
constant factors of performance (both execution time and memory
usage), devoting our effort to finding and validating a robust design
that admits all the necessary freedoms and asymptotically scales
correctly in all dimensions.
