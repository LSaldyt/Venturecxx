TODO

1. Get all 4 kernels running
-----------------------
a. MH (done)
b. Meanfield:
  - pseudocode is there and may be right
  - but there are no variational kernels yet
  ==> add VariationalLKernel / DefaultVariationalLKernel
      add normal gradient
      add normal.variationalLKernel
      and test
      (normal or beta, either one)

c. Gibbs
  - easy, we just enumerate for bernoulli and categorical, and then
    write easy code

d. PGibbs
  - basically unchanged from OldVenturelite, but fairly involved

1.5: Implement the EasyEraseVector to get expected constant-time deletion
     of trace.rcs (and later trace.blocks)

-------
2. Particle refactoring
-------
a. Rewrite the current working version so that regen/detach
   treat nodes as tokens and query the trace for every get/set

b. Copy in and tweak the particle/trace hierarchy from Venturecxx/radulselsamrefactor branch

c. Implement the particle version of trace

d. Confirm asymptotics on pgibbs

e. Parallelize the particles (if possible in python)

-------
3. Mini-inference programming as in VKM email
-------
a. Extend scaffold construction to handle multiple
   different sets of pnodes (pseudocode already written)
b. Have all examples in the email working!
