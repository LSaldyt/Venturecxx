Next, we color green every node that may no longer exist once
the gold nodes are resampled. At this point, the red and gold nodes 
constitute the definite regeneration graph, the blue nodes constitute the absorbing border, and the green nodes constitute the brush.

A torus with two border nodes. Suppose we regenerate the higher one first, and one of the nodes regenerated makes a simulation request. 
Regen then hands over control to eval in order to evaluate the expression.

 extra figure to start that just shows the scaffold.)

 Evaluating the expression might involve referencing other nodes in the trace, for example to resolve a variable lookup. Those nodes may be in the drg and may not have been regenerated yet, so eval must hand over control to regen to guarantee that all values have been regenerated before they are used.
