```venture
sample normal(0, 1)
```
<a number>

```venture
sample normal(0, 1)
```
<another number>

```venture
assume x = normal(0, 1)
```
<a number>
```venture
sample x
```
<same number>

```venture
observe normal(x,1) = 2
sample x
```
<same number>
"nothing happened yet"

```venture
infer posterior
sample x
```
<different number>

```venture
infer posterior
sample x
```
<still different number>

Are these the right distribution?  We could eyeball it like this a bit
more, but it's better to gather data programmatically:

```venture
define data (run (accumulate_dataset 100 (do posterior (collect x))))
```

```venture
infer (printf data)
```

```venture
infer (plotf 'h0 data)
```
