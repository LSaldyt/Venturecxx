sample normal(0, 1)
<a number>
sample normal(0, 1)
<another number>

assume x = normal(0, 1)
<a number>
sample x
<same number>

observe normal(x,1) = 2
sample x
<same number>
"nothing happened yet"

infer posterior
sample x
<different number>

infer posterior
sample x
<still different number>

Are these the right distribution?  We could eyeball it like this a bit more.
