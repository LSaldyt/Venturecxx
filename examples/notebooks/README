Stale IPython notebooks
=======================

As of 4/16/15, these IPython notebooks are stale.

- They may use features of old versions of Venture.

- They may attempt to illustrate Venture concepts that have evolved,
  or whose intended manifestations have evolved.

Issues
======

If and when we choose to resurrect these notebooks, we should consider
the following issues:

- Storing cell outputs in git is a hassle

  - Spurious diffs

  - Useless junk in git grep

  - As of IPython 3, there is a recommended way to non-interactively
    remove cell outputs:
    `ipython nbconvert --to=notebook --ClearOutputPreprocessor.enabled=True foo.ipynb`

  - Before IPython 3, it is possible to write a script to do it, e.g.
    in one of the answers here:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18734739/using-ipython-notebooks-under-version-control?rq=1

  - This can become a git hook

- Manually checking that a notebook still executes cleanly is a hassle

  - As of IPython 3, there is a recommended way to non-interactively
    run notebooks:
    `ipython nbconvert --to=notebook --ExecutePreprocessor.enabled=True foo.ipynb`
    (see also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17905350/running-an-ipython-notebook-non-interactively)

  - Not clear how to do it in IPython 2, or how to check the result
    for error conditions.

  - Even less clear how to check some semantic property of the output;
    perhaps a self-test cell?

  - Not completely clear how to define a smoketest condition that runs
    less inference on fewer datapoints; some boilerplate hack in the
    notebook that reads the Unix environment?

- Many (all?) of the notebooks generate plots, which are intended to
  be rendered inline.  There is some invocation boilerplate that needs
  to be either added to the notebook or to the ipython notebook server
  command or some profile for this to work.

- IPython 3 makes things nicer, but is not packaged for Ubuntu, even
  as of Vivid Vervet.
