This directory contains examples of SPs and inference programs written
against the new Venture backend.

For now, they can be run like this:

$ venture mite -f [path-to-file] -e "define _ = [example-name]()"

For example, to run the first traces example, you would run

$ venture mite -f examples/mite/traces.vnt -e "define _ = example1()"

Currently, the set of extant examples is:
- traces.vnt: various examples of trace metaprogramming and inference
  programming
- beta_binomial.vnt: implementations of the beta-binomial SP
- crp.vnt: an implementation of the CRP
- crp.vnts: a translation of crp.vnt into the concrete syntax
