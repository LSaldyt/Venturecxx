Overview
========

This document is meant to be normative, and therefore changes only by
unanimous consent (except re: availability of new tools, etc).  If you
disagree with something you see here, please raise it.

- We use [Asana](http://asana.com) to coordinate tasks.

- We are trying out [Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/app/mit-probcomp/main) for persistent group chat.
  As of early February 2014, the jury is in deliberations.

- We use [nosetests](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for running the test suite.

- We use [Starcluster](http://star.mit.edu/cluster/) (which is backed by EC2) for cloud compute.

- We use [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) for the continuous build.  As of this writing, the
  server listens to http://ec2-54-84-30-252.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/

- We use [pylint](http://www.pylint.org/) to maintain our Python code style.  The normative
  pylint configuration file is in `tool/pylintrc`.

Particulars
===========

Testing Policy
--------------

- `nosetests -c crashes.cfg` runs the suite to quickly check for
  crashes without measuring inference quality.  Please keep this test
  suite passing on the master branch; raise `nose.SkipTest` if
  necessary.

- We treat a skipped test as an issue.  To wit, resolution is required
  but need not be immediate.  The actual skipped test should be linked
  to an issue in the issue tracker. [*] When that issue is closed, the
  test should be re-enabled.  Issues that have skipped tests
  associated with them should be marked as such, so the tests can be
  found (by grep) and turned back on.

  [*] While we're using Asana as the main issue tracker, this means
  copy the Asana URL of the task into the message given to the
  SkipTest exception.

Test Suite Configuration
------------------------

- `all-crashes` checks for crashes in several generic inference programs.

- `nosetests -c inference-quality.cfg` checks for inference quality
  problems.

- You can select the default inference program (used when the
  particular test doesn't specify) like this:
  `nosetests -c inference-quality.cfg --tc=infer:"(func-pgibbs default ordered 10 3)"`
  The default is `(mh default one 50)`.

- `all-inference-quality` checks inference quality in several generic
  inference programs.  This takes a while.

- You can select the backend against which to run the suite like this:
  `nosetests -c inference-quality.cfg --tc=get_ripl:cxx`
  (the default is `lite`).

- `nosetests -c performance.cfg` checks for performance issues.
  Currently there are only three performance tests, all of which are
  asymptotic checks rather than benchmarks.

- See [test/README.md](https://github.com/mit-probabilistic-computing-project/Venturecxx/tree/master/test)
  for the organization of the test suite.

- The test suite can be run in parallel via the nose multiprocessing
  plugin:
  `--processes=[NUM] --process-timeout=[SECONDS]`
  Note that the timeout is essentially for the whole suite rather than
  per test.

- The test suite can be sliced by test/group in the usual way.

- See `test/nconfig.py` and `test/config.py` for other configuration
  options.

- Python-side code coverage can be obtained via coverage.py and the
  nose-cov plugin by uncommenting the appropriate section in
  `setup.cfg`.  A coverage report is generated by default when doing
  crash testing.

- Ideally, we would define additional task-oriented test launch patterns:
  - Benchmark an inference program in a backend
    - speed per transition
    - convergence per transition
    - convergence per computron
  - Profile the computations triggered by the tests (statistically or by instrumentation)

Starcluster
-----------

- We have a Starcluster Venture plugin in that lets you painlessly get
  a cluster with Venture installed on every node.  See instructions in
  `tool/scventure.py` for how to use it (assuming you already know how
  to use Starcluster).  For development, we suggest you configure the
  plugin to build Venture either from a Github branch or from your
  local clone.

Pylint
------

- Our pylint config doesn't work with the version packaged for Ubuntu,
  so install pylint from pip:
  `sudo pip install pylint`

- You can run pylint in batch mode using the Venture style with, e.g.,
  `pylint --rcfile=tool/pylintrc backend/lite/wttree.py`

- Pylint is more useful if the feedback is instantaneous.  If you edit
    in Emacs, this can be achieved using Flymake Mode:

    1. Either add the `tool/` directory to your PATH, or put a symlink
       on your path named `venture-epylint.py` and pointing to
       `tool/venture-epylint.py`

    2. Make sure your Emacs loads `tool/python-flymake.el` on startup,
       for example by adding `(load-file "/path/to/venture/tool/python-flymake.el")`
       to your `.emacs` file.

- Our attitude towards style violations is:

  - Code you recently understood (i.e., wrote, or heavily modified)
    should conform to the project style.
  - If there is a good reason to deviate from style, add a comment
    with `pylint: disable=<violation-type>` and a comment explaining
    why.
  - If you feel that a particular style constraint is too strict or
    inappropriate in general, let's discuss it.
