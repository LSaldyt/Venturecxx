----- Informal template for building web demos -----

var events_to_process = [];
var raphael_objects = [];

1. Insert HTML (application dependent? maybe want a shared Venture-y look)
1. RenderInit():
   a) All event callbacks add to events_to_process.

2. LoadModel():
   a) Send the generative model to RIPL.
   b) Start with ripl.assume('test_number',unique_id)

3. RenderAll():
   a) Takes the directives as argument.
   
   b) Updates RAPHAEL_OBJECTS:
      i) Removes from RAPHAEL_OBJECTS any object that no longer has a corresponding directive.
      ii) Creates a raphael object for every directive (observation) for which no
      	  object currently exists.

   d) Processes the events:
      i) Forgets any object with a FORGET-event in events_to_process.
      ii) Adds to model (predict/observe) for every ASSUME-event in events_to_process.

      Note: The corresponding objects will not be created/deleted until subsequent calls to RenderAll().
      	    It very important to keep this 4 different steps conceptually distinct.

   f) Updates the settings on all RAPHAEL_OBJECTS as appropriate.

----------------------------

What functionality will we almost always share?
1. The two callbacks for showing progress and then removing the div.
2. StartContinuousInference().
3. Joining the existing Venture demo session if necessary.
4. Updating the code on the RHS.
5. RunDemo().
